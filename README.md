### IreTheKID

A 15-year-old anime fanatic proficient in Python and Ruby, with a little bit of knowledge in C++. I'm currently learning Node and JS. My parents think I'm addicted to programming which is sorta-kinda-maybe true :P Currently looking for a remote computer programming internship position anywhere!
